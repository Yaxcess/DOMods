Only Android.
Default compatibility for every mod: ARM64_v8. If the mod is compatible with any other architecture I will mention it in the release description.

# -------Installation-------

To install any of my mods you need any file explorer. You can use EX Explorer, Google Files, whatever..
Copy the whole folder *'com.hanaGames.DinosOnline'* from the needed .zip to *'/Android/data/'* folder on your device. If it asks you to replace something, do it.
I recommend to launch the game atleast once before installing this mod. If you clear cash or data of the game you'll need to reinstall the mod.

*If you're using vm or cloner app I can't help with installation since there are too many possible vms and cloners.*

Also i have to admit that i **WON'T share** any mods with any other functionality rather than visual changes like grade, chat some ui and experimental features. This means no immo, no infinite points, no modded stats, no cut out detections, no cut out ads, no changed links or other potentially harmful for the game things.

***No, it won't save you from ban whether you deserve it or not.***
